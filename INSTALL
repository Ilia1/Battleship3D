To compile the programme you need to do the following :

qmake -project
qmake
make

if the linking fails (undefined references), edit the Makefile file and add in the LIBS variable : "-lGL -lGLU" and type "make" again
better compilation steps will be soon implemented with hopefully a simple "./configure && make" command to do everything perfectly
